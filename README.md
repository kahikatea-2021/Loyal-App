# Loyal 
A cross platform app created to replace traditional coffee cards. 

## Setup

To get started, clone this repo and then in your terminal run:

Install the Expo client app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer. 
On Android, use the Expo app to scan the QR code that appears in your terminal when you run the project. 
On iOS, use the built-in QR code scanner of the Camera app to scan the QR code that appears in your terminal when you run the project.
